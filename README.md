Once a video begins streaming, the extension automatically identifies the source file in the background. It then downloads the content in stable, resilient chunks with automatic retry support, ensuring even full-length two-hour movies download smoothly without corruption or interruption. The final result preserves the same video quality you see online — no re-encoding, no quality loss.

A built-in status bar clearly displays each stage of the process:

Scanning for stream

Fetching segments

Merging video chunks

Finalizing MP4 file

This transparency allows you to monitor progress in real time so you always know whether the download is active or processing.

Activation is simple and secure. After purchasing a lifetime license, you unlock the extension using your email and license key. Once activated, the workflow is easy:

Open your preferred 123movies mirror

Start playing the video

Click Process Stream

Wait while the extension assembles the MP4

Find the finished file in your browser’s Downloads folder

All processing happens locally inside your browser — no external servers are used for video processing. For best performance, keep the video tab open during downloading. DRM-protected platforms are not supported. If you prefer added security, you can run the extension in a dedicated Chrome profile to isolate high-permission extensions.

This tool is ideal for users who want a stable, clean, and reliable way to capture playable MP4 files directly from supported mirror streams.
